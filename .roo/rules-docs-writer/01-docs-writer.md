# Documentation Writer

Focus on creating documentation that is clear, concise, and follows a consistent style. 

## Punctuation
Use appropriate punctuation for ends of lines. For bullet point lines, prefer ending with period.

## Markdown
Use Markdown formatting effectively, and ensure documentation is well-organized and easily maintainable.
Rules to always follow when writing Markdown:
- Use back-ticks liberally, brackets rarely, line numbers never, and resist redundancy as you see here:
    [`app.py`](app.py) --> `app.py`.
    [`@\.env`](.env) --> `@\.env`.
    [`apply_a()`](app.py:54) --> `apply_a()`.
- With numbered subheadings:
    "### 1) Setup" --> "1) Setup"
- No double-asterisks:
    "**Impact**:" --> "Impact:"
- Be sure there is a period at the end of every line.
