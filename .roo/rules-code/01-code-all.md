1) Try 1 completely different approach.
2) Check `useful discoveries` for potential solution.
3) If `autonomy level` is "med" or "high": Try 1 more novel solution.
4) If `autonomy level` is "high": Try 1 more novel solution.
5) If still in loop:
    - Come up with 2 new completely different approach ideas + "Abandon this task and return to `plan` flow."
    - Show these to user to get direction.
6) If you solve the problem, add to `useful discoveries` file.
